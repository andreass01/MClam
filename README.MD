# MClam
Simplified libclamav wrapper for C#

## What is this?

This is the most up-to-date `libclamav` wrapper to add virus scanning
abilities for your applications.

Well coded using C# with great documentation. I hope this library would
be useful for you.

## Is it stable?

Of course! This library is fully re-written from MClam successor `SharpClam` 
and `ReSharpedClam` which is likely non-stable and had many memory leaks.

## What's next?

I'll continue coding and test it before releasing. This repo is still 
*work in progress*. Use at your cautions.
